    "### Benchmark Evaluation for Illinois Statutes RAG System\n",
    "\n",
    "To evaluate our **Illinois Statutes RAG system**, we created custom benchmark questions due to the absence of pre-existing, Illinois-specific questions. The questions primarily focus on the following areas:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Education**\n",
    "- **Health**\n",
    "- **Regulation**\n",
    "\n",
    "These areas address policies, public safety, and compliance rules.\n",

    "## Question Design\n",
    "\n",
    "### Total Questions: 45\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. **True/False Statements** (15 Questions)\n",
    "- Assess whether a given statement aligns with the statutes.\n",
    "- **Example Question**: Can a licensed currency exchange operate at multiple locations under the same license?  \n",
    "  **Example Answer**: No.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. **Short-Answer Questions** (30 Questions)\n",
    "- Fact-based questions requiring specific answers about acts or provisions.\n",
    "- **Example Question**: What is required for a 16-year-old to donate blood?  \n",
    "  **Example Answer**: Written permission or authorization from their parent or guardian.\n"
